### Hi there 👋

My name is Alex. I am an aspiring Software Developer, and I started my journey back when I was 12 years old using VB.NET. While I primarily write C# and Python code, I am always looking to learn something new.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Discord bots.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Python, JavaScript/React
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: My dream was to become a Video Game Developer... or at the very least, work at a video game company.

### About Me

#### Hobbies and Projects
#### 🔵 Aqua (private repo)
Aqua is a Discord bot written in Python for my personal server. She is named after the main character from the popular anime, [KonoSuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KonoSuba). I use her to experiment with new ideas like COVID-19 notifications powered by [JHU](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and [Pomber](https://github.com/pomber/covid19).

Other features include:
- Anime convention news via RSS.
- Discord voice channel control for rounds of Among Us.
- Automatic YouTube video posting.
- Server Role/Access Management

#### 💎 Crystal (inactive)
[Crystal](https://github.com/AzureKitsune/Crystal) was the framework I used to build Windows applications. It is a MVVM-like framework at its core and I've been working on it since 2012. In its current (third) iteration, it is designed for the Universal Windows Platform (which runs on Windows 10 PCs, phones, Xbox One/Series, HoloLens, etc). It is written in C#.

Crystal v3 helps me follow the MVVM (Model View ViewModel) design pattern, ensuring that my code is testable and reduces code coupling. The ViewModel base class allows me to set up data binding with a view relatively easily. There is a basic implementation of Inversion of Control (IoC) which is useful for mock testing. It also abstracts away different quirks between the various Windows 10 platforms, ensuring that my application runs the same on them. Conversely, it also has platform detection allowing me to design different user interfaces based on the platform. From there, Crystal will determien the correct interface to display.

#### 🟣 Neptunium (retired)
Neptunium was a C# UWP (Universal Windows Platform) application for Windows 10 devices (Windows 10 PCs, phones, Xbox One/Series, HoloLens, etc) designed to stream Shoutcast radio stations from a specific list. As you may have guest, these stations for Japanese and Korean radio stations.

*It was because of this project, I had to learn how to write a library for parsing MP3 audio frames. The library was called [UWPShoutcastMSS](https://github.com/Amrykid/UWPShoutcastMSS) and can be found here*
